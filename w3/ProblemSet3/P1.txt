Let's say Alvin will catch the flu with probability of 1/10 during any given month. Let's also assume that Alvin can catch the flu only once per month, and that if he has caught the flu, the flu virus will die by the end of the month. What is the probability of the following events?



He catches the flu in September, October and November.

    (1/10) * (1/10) * (1/10) = 1/1000

He catches the flu in September and then again in November, but not in October.

    (1/10) * (9/10) * (1/10) = 9/1000

He catches the flu exactly once in the three months from September through November.

    (1/10) * (9/10) * (9/10) * 3 = 243/1000

He catches the flu in two or more of the three months from September through November.

any two month catch flu probability is 1/10 * 1/10 * 9/10 , and we have three option

first and second months catched, third free
second and third months catched, first free
first and third months catched, second free

three months continue catch flu probability is (1/10) * (1/10) * (1/10) = 1/1000

(1/10) * (1/10) * (9/10) * 3 + (1/10) * (1/10) * (1/10) = 27/1000 + 1/1000 = 28/1000 = 7/250
